     * The way that this algorithm works is not self-explanatory, so I will explain it here:
     * 
     * In order to simulate flames, we can use randomness to generate a "heat" value, which
     * can then be translated into a color and a brightness.
     * 
     * This "heat" value needs to be random yet smooth, and changeable smoothly over time.
     * For this reason, Perlin noise is perfect, since it
     *   - is deterministic for a given seed
     *   - is "smooth"
     *   - is "random"
     * 
     * In order to get a pattern which "wraps" around the edges of the LED strip though, we 
     * will need to somehow make our input coordinates to the perlin noise generator similar for
     * opposing ends of the strip.
     * 
     * We can do this by treating the current led index as an "angle" around a circle of leds,
     * where 0 -> 0 radians and N -> 2pi radians if the LED strip is N LEDs long.
     * 
     * We can therefore sample each LED's "heat" value using the following pseudo-code:
     *    heat = noise(center + vec2D.fromMagnitude(SIZE).rotate(ledIndex / ledLength))
     * 
     * Implementing this is a matter of translating these operations into both wpilib and integer
     * or double math.
     * 
     * In order to make our flames evolve over time though, we must move our circle around the 
     * perlin noise space as time advances.
     * 
     * The simplest way to do this--which fortunately does not rely on persistent, mutable fields--
     * is to store a "movement direction" vector and multiply it by the time elapsed since the 
     * animation's start (timer.get()) in order to get the center position.
     * 
     * This movement direction can be initialized alongside the animation using java's Random class.
     * 
     * Finally, to go from our "heat" value to an actual color value, we need to linearly interpolate
     * between a "cool" flame color and a "hot" flame color as well as a dim brightness and high brightness,
     * giving us the components of an HSV color (assuming saturation is always 255).
     * 
     * Because of the nature of linear interpolation, this means that we must re-map our generated "heat" value
     * from [-1, 1], the range provided by PerlinNoise, to [0, 1]. This can be done with
     *    x = x / 2.0 + 0.5
     * 
     * In order to make our flames appear more distinct, we raise this remapped heat value to some power,
     * effectively increasing the threshold of heat values which will produce visibly hot pixels.
     * 
     * We can then pipe the results of the two lerps for hue and val into ledBuffer.setHSV to render
     * our current animation pixel, for every pixel.
