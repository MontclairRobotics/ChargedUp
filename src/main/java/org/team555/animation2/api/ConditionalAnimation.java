/**
 * An animation which chooses from a set of other animations based on

 * and outputs them to its own buffer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This animation does not actually own its buffer, but rather returns the 
 * buffers of the animations it chooses from, to save time costs incurred
 * by copying from them.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The order in which cases are added to matter, and if, while running the animation
 * associated to some case added second, the first case condition becomes true,
 * this animation will immediately switch to using the result of the first case.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This animation does not update each of its options every frame, but rather updates
 * them only when they are the currently rendered option.
